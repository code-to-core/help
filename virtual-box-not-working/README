There are utilities for signing kernel modules so that they
can be loaded into the kernel is secure boot mode. The general
procedure is as follows:

1. Generate and encrypt the signing key and the public key
    (mok-keygen.sh). This will enroll the public key with secure boot
    and ask for a password. You should remember the password and 
    immediately reboot, following prompts to enroll the key

2. Reboot and register the public key with the EFI BIOS

3. When a module need to be signed and loaded, use the signing key
    (Make sure you are absolutely sure of where it came from) and run
    mok-sign-and-load.sh


The kernel will only load signed modules.
The modules are signed with the private key (MOK.priv) which has been encrypted
You will need to know the module signing password to sign a module

When a module is loaded it is checked against the public key in the BIOS
store. No-match => No Load.

If you delete the public key from the machine store, none of the previously 
signed modeules will load.
